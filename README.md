##  Overview
University students today face significant mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression, financial stress, and academic pressure. Unfortunately, many students do not seek help due to stigma or limited access to counseling resources.  

**MindLah** is a mobile-first companion app designed to make mental health support more approachable, friendly, and culturally relevant for students in Malaysia and beyond. The name ‚ÄúLah‚Äù reflects local slang, making the app feel casual and relatable rather than clinical.
